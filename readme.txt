This is a discussion board website for students to discuss the topic of course, which is a substitute of group email.

The website has been deployed on Heroku http://discussion-board.herokuapp.com/

Users can sign up, sign in, sign out. For every course, they can create a new topic, under which, people can answer to that topic. Besides, they can vote for the comment. The website has a users management, which means only the creater can edit/delete their topics and answers.

There are 6 controllers/models/views and they are inter-related. The user interface will be completely done in Task 3.
